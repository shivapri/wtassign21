Held in Carrick-on-Suir on September 27th and 28th, 2020, the event’s concept was that five experts / mentors in various areas (tourism, heritage, public realm, retail, roads and parking) would help the people of Carrick come up with ideas to help tackle their place’s issues. The role of the mentors was to assist the people of the town in coming up with solutions that are sustainable, i.e. that are doable, taking into account the skills and abilities of those who live there.</em></b></i>
